abstract = {From clinical development of cancer therapies to investigations into partisan bias, adaptive sequential designs have become increasingly popular method for causal inference, as they offer the possibility of improved precision over their non-adaptive counterparts. However, even in simple settings (e.g. two treatments) the extent to which adaptive designs can improve precision is not sufficiently well understood. In this work, we study the problem of Adaptive Neyman Allocation in a design-based potential outcomes framework, where the experimenter seeks to construct an adaptive design which is nearly as efficient as the optimal (but infeasible) non-adaptive Neyman design, which has access to all potential outcomes. Motivated by connections to online optimization, we propose Neyman Ratio and Neyman Regret as two (equivalent) performance measures of adaptive designs for this problem. We present Clip-OGD, an adaptive design which achieves {\$}\backslashwidetilde{\{}O{\}}(\backslashsqrt{\{}T{\}}){\$} expected Neyman regret and thereby recovers the optimal Neyman variance in large samples. Finally, we construct a conservative variance estimator which facilitates the development of asymptotically valid confidence intervals. To complement our theoretical results, we conduct simulations using data from a microeconomic experiment.},

abstract = {It has become increasingly common for data to be collected adaptively, for example using contextual bandits. Historical data of this type can be used to evaluate other treatment assignment policies to guide future innovation or experiments. However, policy evaluation is challenging if the target policy differs from the one used to collect data, and popular estimators, including doubly robust (DR) estimators, can be plagued by bias, excessive variance, or both. In particular, when the pattern of treatment assignment in the collected data looks little like the pattern generated by the policy to be evaluated, the importance weights used in DR estimators explode, leading to excessive variance. In this paper, we improve the DR estimator by adaptively weighting observations to control its variance. We show that a t-statistic based on our improved estimator is asymptotically normal under certain conditions, allowing us to form confidence intervals and test hypotheses. Using synthetic data and public benchmarks, we provide empirical evidence for our estimator's improved accuracy and inferential properties relative to existing alternatives.},

@article{Ye2023,
abstract = {Evaluating the performance of an ongoing policy plays a vital role in many areas such as medicine and economics, to provide crucial instruction on the early-stop of the online experiment and timely feedback from the environment. Policy evaluation in online learning thus attracts increasing attention by inferring the mean outcome of the optimal policy (i.e., the value) in real-time. Yet, such a problem is particularly challenging due to the dependent data generated in the online environment, the unknown optimal policy, and the complex exploration and exploitation trade-off in the adaptive experiment. In this paper, we aim to overcome these difficulties in policy evaluation for online learning. We explicitly derive the probability of exploration that quantifies the probability of exploring the non-optimal actions under commonly used bandit algorithms. We use this probability to conduct valid inference on the online conditional mean estimator under each action and develop the doubly robust interval estimation (DREAM) method to infer the value under the estimated optimal policy in online learning. The proposed value estimator provides double protection on the consistency and is asymptotically normal with a Wald-type confidence interval provided. Extensive simulations and real data applications are conducted to demonstrate the empirical validity of the proposed DREAM method.},

abstract = {Adaptive collection of data is commonplace in applications throughout science and engineering. From the point of view of statistical inference, however, adaptive data collection induces memory and correlation in the samples, and poses significant challenge. We consider the high-dimensional linear regression, where the samples are collected adaptively, and the sample size n can be smaller than p, the number of covariates. In this setting, there are two distinct sources of bias: the first due to regularization imposed for consistent estimation, for example, using the LASSO, and the second due to adaptivity in collecting the samples. We propose “online debiasing,” a general procedure for estimators such as the LASSO, which addresses both sources of bias. In two concrete contexts (i) time series analysis and (ii) batched data collection, we demonstrate that online debiasing optimally debiases the LASSO estimate when the underlying parameter $\theta$ 0 has sparsity of order (Formula presented.). In this regime, the debiased estimator can be used to compute p-values and confidence intervals of optimal size.},

abstract = {Bandit algorithms are increasingly used in real-world sequential decision-making problems. Associated with this is an increased desire to be able to use the resulting datasets to answer scientific questions like: Did one type of ad lead to more purchases? In which contexts is a mobile health intervention effective? However, classical statistical approaches fail to provide valid confidence intervals when used with data collected with bandit algorithms. Alternative methods have recently been developed for simple models (e.g., comparison of means). Yet there is a lack of general methods for conducting statistical inference using more complex models on data collected with (contextual) bandit algorithms; for example, current methods cannot be used for valid inference on parameters in a logistic regression model for a binary reward. In this work, we develop theory justifying the use of M-estimators—which includes estimators based on empirical risk minimization as well as maximum likelihood—on data collected with adaptive algorithms, including (contextual) bandit algorithms. Specifically, we show that M-estimators, modified with particular adaptive weights, can be used to construct asymptotically valid confidence regions for a variety of inferential targets.},

Small differences in key metrics, on the order of fractions of a percent, may have very significant business implications. At Bing it is not uncommon to see experiments that impact annual revenue by millions of dollars, even tens of millions of dollars, either positively or negatively. With thousands of experiments being run annually, improving the sensitivity of experiments allows for more precise assessment of value, or equivalently running the experiments on smaller populations (supporting more experiments) or for shorter durations (improving the feedback cycle and agility). We propose an approach (CUPED) that utilizes data from the pre-experiment period to reduce metric variability and hence achieve better sensitivity. This technique is applicable to a wide variety of key business metrics, and it is practical and easy to implement. The results on Bing's experimentation system are very successful: we can reduce variance by about 50{\%}, effectively achieving the same statistical power with only half of the users, or half the duration. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {When data is collected in an adaptive manner, even simple methods like ordinary least squares can exhibit non-normal asymptotic behavior. As an undesirable consequence, hypothesis tests and confidence intervals based on asymptotic normality can lead to erroneous results. We propose an online debiasing estimator to correct these distributional anomalies in least squares estimation. Our proposed method takes advantage of the covariance structure present in the dataset and provides sharper estimates in directions for which more information has accrued. We establish an asymptotic normality property for our proposed online debiasing estimator under mild conditions on the data collection process, and provide asymptotically exact confidence intervals. We additionally prove a minimax lower bound for the adaptive linear regression problem, thereby providing a baseline by which to compare estimators. There are various conditions under which our proposed estimator achieves the minimax lower bound up to logarithmic factors. We demonstrate the usefulness of our theory via applications to multi-armed bandit, autoregressive time series estimation, and active learning with exploration.},

We study this problem under the setup of the contextual bandit framework with a linear reward model. The $\epsilon$-greedy policy is adopted to address the classic exploration-and-exploitation dilemma. Using the martingale central limit theorem, we show that the online ordinary least squares estimator of model parameters is asymptotically normal. When the linear model is misspecified, we propose the online weighted least squares estimator using the inverse propensity score weighting and also establish its asymptotic normality. Based on the properties of the parameter estimators, we further show that the in-sample inverse propensity weighted value estimator is asymptotically normal.

This central limit theorem enables efficient inference at fixed sample sizes.

In such experiments, the experimenter first stratifies the sample according to observed baseline covariates and then assigns treatment randomly within these strata so as to achieve balance according to pre-specified stratum-specific target assignment proportions. In this paper, we compute the semiparametric efficiency bound for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) in such experiments with binary treatments allowing for the class of CAR procedures considered in Bugni, Canay, and Shaikh (2018, 2019). This is a broad class of procedures and is motivated by those used in practice. The stratum-specific target proportions play the role of the propensity score conditional on all baseline covariates (and not just the strata) in these experiments. Thus, the efficiency bound is a special case of the bound in Hahn (1998), but conditional on all baseline covariates. Additionally, this efficiency bound is shown to be achievable under the same conditions as those used to derive the bound by using a cross-fitted Nadaraya-Watson kernel estimator to form nonparametric regression adjustments.},

abstract = {In a wide variety of applications, including healthcare, bidding in first price auctions, digital recommendations, and online education, it can be beneficial to learn a policy that assigns treatments to individuals based on their characteristics. The growing policy-learning literature focuses on settings in which policies are learned from historical data in which the treatment assignment rule is fixed throughout the data-collection period. However, adaptive data collection is becoming more common in practice from two primary sources: (1) data collected from adaptive experiments that are designed to improve inferential efficiency and (2) data collected from production systems that progressively evolve an operational policy to improve performance over time (e.g., contextual bandits). Yet adaptivity complicates the problem of learning an optimal policy ex post for two reasons: first, samples are dependent and, second, an adaptive assignment rule may not assign each treatment to each type of individual sufficiently often. In this paper, we address these challenges. We propose an algorithm based on generalized augmented inverse propensity weighted (AIPW) estimators, which nonuniformly reweight the elements of a standard AIPW estimator to control worst case estimation variance. We establish a finite-sample regret upper bound for our algorithm and complement it with a regret lower bound that quantifies the fundamental difficulty of policy learning with adaptive data. When equipped with the best weighting scheme, our algorithm achieves minimax rate-optimal regret guarantees even with diminishing exploration. Finally, we demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness using both synthetic data and public benchmark data sets.This paper was accepted by Hamid Nazerzadeh, data science.Funding: This work is supported by the National Science Foundation [Grant CCF-2106508].

In the luckiest cases, measurements lead to the discovery of new physical phenomena that may represent a breakthrough in the knowledge of Nature. Measurements, and, more in general, observations of Nature's behavior, are performed with experiments that record quantitative information about the physical phenomenon under observation.},

  abstract = 	 {We present a new algorithm for the contextual bandit learning problem,  where the learner repeatedly takes one of K \emphactions in response to the  observed \emphcontext, and observes the \emphreward only for that  action. Our method assumes access to an oracle for solving fully  supervised cost-sensitive classification problems and achieves the  statistically optimal regret guarantee with only \otil(\sqrtKT)  oracle calls across all T rounds. By doing so, we obtain the most  practical contextual bandit learning algorithm amongst approaches that  work for general policy classes.  We conduct a  proof-of-concept experiment which demonstrates the excellent  computational and statistical performance of (an online variant of) our  algorithm relative to several strong baselines.}
